# Fixed Authentication Issues

## Problems Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Token Key Mismatch** âœ…
- **Issue**: Chat page was looking for `token` but login stores `authToken`
- **Fix**: Updated chat page to use `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`

### 2. **User ID Access** âœ…
- **Issue**: Chat page was using `localStorage.getItem('userId')` which doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Added `currentUser` state and `fetchCurrentUser()` function
- **Updated**: Message ownership and chat participant detection

### 3. **JWT Payload Inconsistency** âœ…
- **Issue**: JWT was created with `id` but used `_id` in some places
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated JWT creation to use `_id` consistently
  - Updated JWT strategy to handle both `id` and `_id` for backwards compatibility
  - Added fallback JWT secret

### 4. **Authentication Flow** âœ…
- **Issue**: No proper redirect when user not authenticated
- **Fix**: 
  - Added authentication check in chat page
  - Redirect to login when no token found
  - Better loading states and error handling

## Updated Files:

### **Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Fixed token access, user state, authentication flow
- Added proper authentication checks and redirects

### **Backend:**
- `controllers/users_controller.js` - Fixed JWT payload to use `_id`
- `config/passport-jwt-strategy.js` - Handle both `id` and `_id` in JWT
- `routes/users.js` - Fixed Google OAuth JWT payload
- `config/chat_sockets.js` - Handle both `id` and `_id` in socket auth

## Test Instructions:

1. **Start Backend**: `npm start`
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. **Login**: Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
4. **Test Chat**: After login, click ðŸ’¬ icon in bottom nav

## Expected Behavior:
- âœ… No more "No auth token found" error
- âœ… Chat page loads properly after authentication
- âœ… User can see their chats and start new conversations
- âœ… Proper redirect to login if not authenticated

The authentication flow is now properly integrated between the login system and chat functionality!
